        Tips for a Morning Routine That Supports Mental Health
      </h1>

      <p class="text">
        A morning routine is a set of actions or activities that you 
        do every morning to help you start your day on the right foot. Having a consistent 
        morning routine can help you improve your mental health, increase productivity, 
        and set a positive tone for the rest of the day.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text">
        There are many different types of morning routines, and what works for 
        one person may not work for another. Some common elements of a morning routine include 
        things like drinking water, stretching, meditating, journaling, or exercising. 
        It's important to find a routine that works for you and that you enjoy, so that you're 
        more likely to stick with it over time.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        By establishing a healthy morning routine, you can improve your physical 
        and mental well-being, boost your energy levels, and increase your overall sense of 
        happiness and fulfillment. So if you're not already following a morning routine, it might 
        be worth considering adding one to your daily routine.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Multiple studies have shown that establishing routines filled with healthy habits is a 
        great way to move more efficiently through your day while expending less mental energy 
        and even willpower in the process. A 2015 study on the psychology of habits demonstrated 
        that people may rely more heavily on habits when stressed, suggesting that forming healthy 
        routines could help people maintain physical, emotional, and mental health during stressful 
        times.
      </p>

      <h5 class="paragraph_heading h5">
        HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE IN THE MORNING?
      </h5>

      <p class="text">
        When building your morning routine, it's important to consider how much time you have. 
        Even if you only have 20 minutes to spare each morning, you can use that time to promote 
        good mental health.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        If you have a very limited amount of time in the morning, try identifying your biggest 
        pain points or stressors as you move through your morning rather than seeking to cram a 
        variety of activities and tasks into a small window of time. Then consider how forming a 
        habit could help you mitigate those pain points. For instance, someone who routinely 
        doesn't have time for breakfast might plan and prepare their meals ahead of time so that 
        a healthy option is always available to grab on their way out the door.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Having somewhere to be first thing in the morning doesn't have to mean limited time for 
        a morning routine. If you are a morning person or prefer to rise at an earlier hour than 
        most, you may have more time to dedicate to a morning routine.
      </p>

  
      <p class="text">
        Those who have close to an hour or longer to dedicate to a morning routine might take a 
        different route when choosing which habits will best support their well-being throughout 
        the rest of the day. Someone might decide to dedicate more time to a physical activity 
        and go for a walk or run, take an exercise class, or practice yoga. Spending more time 
        on meditation, planning the rest of the day, or preparing a healthful meal might also be 
        easier to accommodate with this schedule.
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph_heading">
        The Benefits of Establishing a Consistent Morning Routine
      </h3>

      <ol>

        <li>A morning routine can help reduce stress and anxiety by providing a sense of 
          structure and predictability to your day.</li>

        <li>By starting your day with healthy habits like exercise or healthy eating, you
           can set the tone for a healthier lifestyle overall.</li>

        <li>A morning routine can help you prioritize your time and ensure that you're focusing 
          on the things that are most important to you.</li>

        <li>By taking time in the morning to reflect on your goals and intentions for the day, 
          you can feel more focused and motivated throughout the day.</li>

        <li>Having a consistent morning routine can help you establish a sense of self-discipline 
          and control over your life, which can lead to increased feelings of confidence and 
          empowerment.</li>

        <li>A morning routine can also provide a sense of self-care and self-love, as you prioritize
           taking care of yourself first thing in the morning.</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="text">
        Overall, a morning routine can have many benefits for your physical and mental health, 
        and can help you create a more fulfilling and productive life. So if you're not already 
        following a morning routine, it might be worth considering adding one to your daily routine.

                  Exposure to bright light first thing in the morning increases 
                  feelings of wakefulness. To clear away morning grogginess, take in some sunlight 
                  within the first 5 to 10 minutes of waking up in the morning. Exposure to sunlight 
                  can have a positive impact on mental health by regulating sleep, and reducing 
                  symptoms of anxiety and depression.

                  Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, 
                  and make your bedroom a sleep-friendly environment. Avoid screens, caffeine, 
                  and alcohol before bed, and invest in comfortable bedding. By getting enough rest, 
                  the body is better equipped to manage stress, which can have a positive impact on 
                  mental health.

                  Drink a glass of water to rehydrate after a night's sleep and

                  sleep-wake cycle, which in turn can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. Overall, staying hydrated is an important part of maintaining good mental health and well-being.

                  Nourishing the body with a balanced and nutritious diet can have several

                  with essential nutrients that are important for brain function, including 
                  memory and focus. Finally, eating a healthy diet can improve gut health,

                  Avoiding technology, or at least reducing its use, can have several positive 
                  effects on mental health. Social media and other digital platforms can contribute 
                  to feelings of isolation, comparison, and low self-esteem, which can lead to 
                  symptoms of anxiety and depression. Reducing technology use can encourage 
                  individuals to engage in other activities, such as exercise, socializing, and 
                  hobbies, which have been linked to better mental health outcomes.
